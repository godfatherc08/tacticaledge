		Xavi's Barcelona have been a breath of fresh air in the sights of the 
		Barcelona faithful, after so many managers hired to take the reigns at 
		the camp Nou, they haven't been able to fulfill the most desired element 
		in the Barcelona way, play our possession football. The brand of 
		football that has come to be the Barcelona way, the DNA, attacking, 
		entertaining and possession based soccer that has brought this club to 
		the pinnacle of football. Today, we take a look at Xavi's Barcelona and 
		how his first full season in charge went.</font></p>

		<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="margin-left: 21.0pt">
		<font color="#FFFFFF">In terms of signings, generally the right calls 
		were made in signing players like Raphina, who contributed heavily with 
		very important goals during the campaign Christensen has turned out to 
		be a surprise package, Kessie, of course scoring the goal that gave them 
		the all important Clasico win that all but won them the title. Another 
		standout signing is Jules Kounde who actually didn't play as much in his 
		best position, Centre Back, but at the position that Barca has not been 
		able to solve for quite some time, right back. The most impactful 
		signing definitely, Robert Lewandoski, Barca's star man and top 
		goalscorer this season.All in all, great transfer business from the 
		financially hurt giants.</font></p>

		with his feet and hands making very important saveas durin g the 
		campaign. His passing ability is also a bonus for the Blaugrana.</font></p>

		shows the standout performers in that kind of 4-2-3-1 defensive shape 
		with the available winger dropping deeper to form a defensive overload 
		on his side. Frenkie and Busquets are absolutely vital seeing they are 
		double pivots protecting the backline as they rank high in number of 
		defensive third tackles and interceptions in general. In terms of 
		clearances, Kounde and Balde are standout performers. The influence of 
		Xavi's midfielders in the defensive setup just shows is desire for every 
		member of his squad to work hard for the team both defensively and 
		attacking wise. Looking at the stats, it might be quite deceiving the 
		effort put in by the back line, but they are very involved always making 
		key defensive contributions and their passing range and quality also 
		offer something attacking wise, this is why this defense was the best in 
		Europe this season.</font></p>

		Xavi showed a lot of growth in tactical ideas and independency to devise

		De Jong, the Dutchman as

		Xavi's Barcelona also grew in an attacking sense, moving with better 
		fluidity in the early stages of the season, the system was very unsure 
		from the start of the season, with how he should play with his wingers, 
		whether two straight up wingers like Dembele and Raphina on both wings 
		as we saw in the first Clasico of the season at the Bernabeu or one of 
		the aforementioned players on the right wing and a better inside forward 
		like Ansu Fati or Ferran, this was abandoned later on in favour of the 
		four man midfield. Dembele and Raphina are single handedly responsible 
		for the most crosses in the Barca team which highlights very well their 
		tactical role, that is out wide, looking to the beat man, cross, and add
